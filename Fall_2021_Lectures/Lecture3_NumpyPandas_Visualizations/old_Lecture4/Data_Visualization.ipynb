Often, lineplots are used to illustrate a trend in data values over a series of time, and hence the line follows chronological order from left to right; more specifically this plot would be called a *time series* plot."

    "Scatterplots are used to visualize relationships between **two numeric variables**, particularly if both of them are continuous numeric. A scatterplot consists of data points, or *markers*, that are plotted on an *x,y* coordinate plane. Each data point represents a single observation from a dataset and is characterized by two variables, one mapped to the x-axis and the other mapped to the y-axis.\n",

Hence, a scatterplot often resembles **a cloud of data points** that hopefully resemble some discernible trend that can be used to summarize some sort of relationship or correlation between the x-variable and the y-variable."

    "Understanding what types of data you're working with—and hence what types of variables your data has—is essential when determining what kinds of visualizations may be most appropriate and most effective to illustrate your data. Not all visualizations are suited for all types of data! It is also important to understand the types of variables in your dataset when considering what specific goal(s) you want to accomplish with your visualizations; this concept will become more clear as we continue through this lecture notebook.\n",

    "- **Qualitative/Categorical**: a variable that has discrete values or distinct characteristics that represent *categories*\n",
    "    - **Ordinal**: a categorical variable whose categories have a clear *ordering* or sequence, so the categories have a numerical or sequential meaning. \n",
    "        - e.g. education level: `elementary school`, `middle school`, `high school`; year in Berkeley: `freshman`, `sophomore`, `junior`, `senior`\n",
    "    - **Nominal**: a categorial variable whose categories exist by *name* only, with no inherent numerical value or sequential ordering\n",
    "        - e.g. `Cal ID number`; major at UC Berkeley: `data science`, `statistics`, `computer science`, `economics`\n",
    "- **Quantitative/Numerical**: a variable that is measured on a numeric scale\n",
    "    - **Continuous**: a quantitative variable that can take on an infinite number of values; think of continuous quantitative variables as things you can measure.\n",
    "        - e.g. `weight`, `temperature`\n",
    "    - **Discrete**: a quantitative variable that can only take on certain values, usually integer values; think of discrete quantitative variables as things you can count.\n",

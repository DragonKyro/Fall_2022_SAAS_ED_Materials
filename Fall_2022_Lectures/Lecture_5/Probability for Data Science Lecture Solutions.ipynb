    "We just defined the binomial distribution as number of sucesses in $n$ trials. When we flip a coin, our coin can land in one of 2 categories: heads or tails. We can extend this to multiple classes. If we were drawing from a jar of red, green, and white balls with replacement, we can calculate the distribution of how many red, green, and white balls we chose. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the binomial case, when we calculate the probability of getting k successes, we are also essentially saying we want to get n - k failures. In the multinomial case with more than 2 categories, we have to define ourselves how many we want in each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating the multinomial distribution is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(N_1 = n_1, N_2 = n_2, ..., N_k = n_k) = \\frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!...n_k!}p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}...p_k^{n_k}$$\n",

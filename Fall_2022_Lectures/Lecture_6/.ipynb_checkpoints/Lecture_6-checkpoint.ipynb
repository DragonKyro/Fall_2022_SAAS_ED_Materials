    "## Motivation\n",
    "Linear algebra is the study of vector spaces, and it encompasses linear equations and functions represented by vector spaces and matrices.\n",
    "Vectors and matrices are essential for storing data, which is why we often use Python packages such as Numpy and Pandas.\n",
    "A common problem is linear regression, which we will delve into solving using matrices and linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='Example'></a>\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "<img src='https://www.scdn.co/i/_global/open-graph-default.png' width='500px' />\n",
    "Spotify vectorizes their songs in order to find things that you might like. They can find the distance between some of your favorite songs and other songs by artists you haven't listened to before in order to help you discover new artists and songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='notation'></a>\n",
    "## Notation\n",
    "Common notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{A}$: Bold capital letters represent matrices\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{x}$: Bold lowercase letters represent vectors\n",
    "* $\\theta$: Non-bold values represent scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='terminology'></a>\n",
    "## Matrix Terminology\n",
    "* **Identity** matrix: A square matrix with diagonal elements equal to $1$ and all off diagonal elements equal to zero. A $n\\times n$ identity matrix is often denoted as $I$ or $I_n$.\n",
    "* **Order or Size** of matrix: If a matrix has m rows and n columns, the order of the matrix is $m\\times n$. We denote the set of (real-valued) matrices $\\mathbb{M}_{m,n}$\n",
    "* **Transpose** of a matrix: The transpose of matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ satisfies the condition $\\mathbf{A_{j,i}} = \\mathbf{A_{i,j}}^T$. That is, the first row of $\\mathbf{A}$ is the first column of $\\mathbf{A}^T$.\n",
    "* **Square** matrix: A matrix with the same number of rows as columns. This matrix is in the shape of a square.\n",
    "* **Diagonal** matrix: A matrix with all the non-diagonal elements equal to $0$ is called a diagonal matrix.\n",
    "* **Scalar** matrix: An identity matrix multiplied by a constant.\n",
    "* **Column** matrix: A matrix which consists of exactly $1$ column. If it has $m$ rows, it can be treated as a $m\\times 1$ vector. \n",
    "* **Row** matrix: A matrix which consists of exactly $1$ row. If it has $n$ columns, it can be treated as a $1\\times n$ vector. \n",
    "* **Determinant**: A scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix and encodes certain properties of the linear transformation described by the matrix.\n",
    "* **Rank**: The maximal number of linearly independent columns of a matrix.\n"

    "### Why Make A Model?\n",
    "We often find that in the real world, many problems can be (accurately) described by models created by you, the data scientist. You can make a model as an attempt to describe the relationship between many related things, such as the year a computer was made as well as how much memory it can hold. With enough data, you can begin to make predictions such as how much memory a computer may hold in 5 years (hence, the create of [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law))\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to keep in mind what you are analyzing. Just because you can make a model describing the relationship between two variables, and even if you can use this model to predict the value of one variable based on the value of the other, it doesn't mean that one causes the other. You may have heard this before as the difference between **correlation** and **causation**. A classic example is the relationship between ice cream sales and murder rates. Turns out, when ice cream sales rise, so do murder rates. Does this mean ice cream *causes* people to commit murder? Or get murdered? Nope!\n",

    "## Linear Regression\n",
    "**Linear regression** is a method of making linear models. Linear model is one kind of model, in which the relationship between the explanatory variables and the response variable can be described by a linear function. For now, you can just think of a linear function as a straight line, which takes us to *simple linear regression*.\n",

We are *assuming* that this is the *true* relationship between $x$ and $y$.\n",

    "Using known $x$'s, we want to accurately predict $y$ using the right $\\hat{\\theta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\theta}_1$.

Hence, the data points we have follow\n",

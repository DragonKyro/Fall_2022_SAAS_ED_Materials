    "\n",
    "1. It extends the functionality of the classic jupyter notebook. For example, you can move a cell by using the cursor to drag it. You also have the access to a **debugger**. \n",
    "2. It has an extra left sidebar that shows the file management system, Git, etc.\n",
    "3. It has more customization to optimize your coding experience (e.g. splitting the screen, changing the font and interface color)\n",

    "With JupyterLab, you can code whenever and wherever you want!\n",
